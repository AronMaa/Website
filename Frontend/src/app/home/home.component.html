    <h2>What is SOC Analysis?</h2>
    <p>
      A security operations center (SOC) is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring
      and managing an organization's security posture. It is typically staffed by security
      professionals who are responsible for identifying, responding to and mitigating security
      threats. In short, a SOC team is responsible for making sure an organization is operating
      securely at all times.

  <section class="purpose">
    <h2>Purpose of SOC Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      SOCs were created to facilitate collaboration among security personnel.
      They streamline the security incident handling process as well as help
      analysts triage and resolve security incidents more efficiently and effectively.
      The SOC’s goal is to gain a complete view of the business’ threat landscape,
      including not only the various types of endpoints, servers and software on-premises
      but also third-party services and traffic flowing between these assets.

  <section class="functions">
    <h2>Key functions of a SOC </h2>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity incidents can be identified and responded to by SOC staff who possess
      the necessary skills. The team collaborates with other departments to share information
      with relevant stakeholders regarding incidents. They operate 24/7, with employees working
      in shifts to mitigate threats and manage log activity, and third-party providers hired to
      provide SOC services for organizations.

  <section class="tiers">
    <h2>Tiers in the team</h2>
    <p>
      Security operations teams commonly deliver on incidents using a tiered structure that accounts for the experience levels
      of their analysts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triage is the first level of the SOC. Tier 1 personnel are responsible for triaging incoming security incidents
      and determining the severity of the incident. This includes identifying the source of the incident, determining
      the scope of the incident and assessing the impact of the incident. They are also responsible for providing initial
      response and containment measures, as well as escalating incidents to higher tiers if necessary. This is where security
      analysts typically spend most of their time. They are typically the least experienced analysts, and their primary
      function is to monitor event logs for suspicious activity. When they feel something needs further investigation,
      they gather as much information as possible and escalate the incident to Tier 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investigation is the second level of the SOC. Tier 2 personnel are responsible for investigating security incidents
      and determining the root cause of the incident. This includes analyzing logs, network traffic and other data sources
      to identify the source of the incident. They are also responsible for providing detailed incident reports and
      recommendations for remediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threat Hunting is the third level of the SOC. Tier 3 personnel are responsible for proactively hunting for threats
      and vulnerabilities in an organization's environment. This includes analyzing logs, network traffic and other data
      sources to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. They are also responsible for providing detailed threat
      intelligence reports and recommendations for remediation. The most experienced analysts support complex incident
      response and spend any remaining time looking through forensic and telemetry data for threats that detection software
      may not have identified as suspicious. The average company spends the least time on threat hunting activities, as Tier 1
      and Tier 2 consume so many analyst resources.

  <section class="careers">
    <h2>Careers in SOC Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      SOC analysis offers numerous career opportunities, ranging from entry-level positions like SOC Analyst Tier 1 to advanced roles such as
      Incident Response Manager or Cybersecurity Specialist. Skills required include knowledge of network protocols, threat intelligence,
      and proficiency in using cybersecurity tools. Certifications like CompTIA Security+, CISSP, or CEH can greatly enhance job prospects.

    <h2>Why SOC Analysis Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s interconnected world, cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever. SOC analysis plays a critical role in safeguarding
      an organization’s reputation, finances, and data. Whether you're looking to secure your systems or embark on a career in cybersecurity,
      understanding SOC analysis is a step in the right direction.
